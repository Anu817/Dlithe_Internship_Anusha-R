DLithe Internship is mainly based on enhancing the skills of an individual by supporting them to do the work they are interested in.

In this internship program all the work is executed on google colab.

Working on a data science project is always exciting.However, setting up your working environment, installing requisite packages, safe storage of all project files, and overcoming the computing limitations of your machine can often be challenging.

Google Colab can help simplify and supercharge your data science workflow.
Google Colab is a cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment from Google Research. With its simple and easy-to-use interface, Colab helps you get started with your data science journey with almost no setup.

Head over to colab.research.google.com. You'll see the following screen. To be able to write and run code, you need to sign in with your Google credentials. This is the only step that's required from your end. No other configuration is needed.

Google Colab is a self-contained environment. It allows you to write Python code as well as text—using markdown cells—to include rich text and media, as shown below. This helps in adding instructions for a step-by-step walkthrough of the project, thereby improving readability.

After downloading the colab file it can be opened on the web browser and connected to your google drive.

Then you can go through each cell and edit the required changes on your end.

To upload files containing the data from your local machine, click on the 'File upload' icon in the 'Files' tab as shown below, and choose the file that you'd like to upload. The datasets provided must be downloaded and opened through the above steps to execute the programs.

All the cells can be run individually or all at once through the Runtime option above.
